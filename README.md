# RC Car Controller Enhancement Branch


In this branch, we've intricately mapped each button on the PS4 controller to execute specific, tailored commands for RC cars, ensuring a sophisticated and intuitive control scheme. Our development focuses on leveraging the seamless connectivity between the ESP32 module and the PS4 controller, optimizing for responsiveness and stability in wireless communication.
